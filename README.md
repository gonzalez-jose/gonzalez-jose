## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ My name is Jose. 

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating the basics of pipelines for data engineering. 

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of Github and improving my technical skills. 

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything!!

âš¡ Fun fact: I was the connect four champion for 2nd and 3rd grade. I haven't reached such heights since.
